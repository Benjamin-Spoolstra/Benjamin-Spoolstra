# Hi I'm Benjamin Spoolstra!

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!

I'm an aspiring Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst and cybersecurity professional with a passion for network, application, and cloud security. 

I'm studying for a B.S. of Cybersecurity at GCU with honors and I've achieved my CompTIA Security+ and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifications.

I've worked in the IT industry as a help desk technician for a few months as of writing this and I'm learning the foundational IT skills needed to secure organizational environments through various projects, CTFs, and labs.

## Objective

I'm working towards developing a well-rounded skillset of both defense and penetration testing skills. These skills will give me the ability to understand attacks, trace their root causes, understand their motives, and work to prevent or mitigate these attacks in the future. 

I want to use this skills to work as a Tier 1 or Junior SOC analyst after I graduate in 2027.
